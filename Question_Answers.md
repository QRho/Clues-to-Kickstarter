1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3

A.Kickstarter is a successful funding platform for certain types of muisic namely: hardwarve, indierock,pop,electronic music and classical, as well as certian performative arts such as theatre plays and media arts such as,film shorts,documentaries,and television.

B.It seems that there are alot of people using kickstarter for funding for plays.
Jan-May seems to be the best time to launch a successful campaign. 

C.There are so many people with such amazing creative ideas that they want to share with the world!



#What are some limitations of this dataset? 

We don't get to see how fully each person filled out their campaign page or examine the quality of the work they put into their project. We dont know if they shared their campiagn via marketing or elsewhere.


3.)What are some other possible table or graphs that we could create? 

We could create a scatterplot based on the purpose or intention of each project  (entertainment, activism, awareness, aesthetic beauty, nature conservation etc... ),in order to help promote the projets to certain philanthropical organizations,angel investors etc, to choose the project they want to get invoved with.

We could also do some stats on which dollar ammounts are most successful. I would think that there could be a correlation or sweet spot in the ammount of money being asked for example min pledge vs any dollar amount accepted, and those that are successful.
